The Raleigh Tailor is a concierge tailoring service. We come to you!
No need to haul around several pairs of shoes or a pile of clothing to the tailors.
We come to your home pin or mark your garments and then take them back to our
studio. Once the alteration are done we will deliver them back to you within a
week or sooner depending on how many garments you have. Our mission is to build
a relationship with our clients. To learn your style and how you like your clothing
to look and fit. All of our tailors are European trained and have many years of
experience. The tailor who pins or marks your garment will be the one who sews
your garment, this will results in the best outcome for your clothing. Please
contact us to set up an appointment.
