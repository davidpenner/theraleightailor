### CLOSET CLEAN OUT

A closet clean out is an 2 hour appointment where we combine styling and tailoring.
We will go through your closet and determined what needs altering, what to keep
and what to donated. As you try on your clothes we will mark/pin your garments
as needed and discuss your style options. After we are done we will organize your
clothing and take the clothes that need altering with us to be fixed and will
be delivered back to you at a later date. We will also haul aways everything you
want to donate and make sure it goes to local charities.
