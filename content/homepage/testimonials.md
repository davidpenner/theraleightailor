##### ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Brandon B.

Dana always does a great job adding additional length to my pants.
(I'm 6'6".) I'm always a happy customer when I leave here. :-)

##### ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Beth E.

We have brought several items to Dana for tailoring. Dresses for
my daughter's wedding, shirts and slacks for my husband, a repair on a coat for
my son.  Everything was tailored to perfection.  I, too, would give her 6 stars
if possible!

##### ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - Mary M.
  message: I rely on Dana so much- as a petite almost everything I buy needs
    some tweaking. I trust her opinion for the right look, length, etc - although she's
    certainly willing to follow your wishes. She's exceptionally skilled & today educated
    me around sleeve length & button holes. She's a great resource.
